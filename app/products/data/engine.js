Beyond AVTEC, we provide recon solutions for non-franchise BEML and Komatsu equipment. For BEML (e.g., BH-100 dumpers, dozers, graders), we offer outright sales or recon-exchange programs to minimize downtime. Komatsu transmissions are rebuilt to OEM standards, delivering like-new performance.

Our overhaul process includes inspection, diagnostics, disassembly, cleaning, reconditioning, replacement with genuine spares, precision reassembly, and final load testing.

Workshops at Prithla and Ballabgarh (Delhi NCR) feature advanced machinery, testing benches, and reconditioned exchange units for fast turnaround, with on-site commissioning support.

We are committed to precision, durability, and customer-focused service—ensuring heavy equipment runs efficiently with minimal downtime.`,
